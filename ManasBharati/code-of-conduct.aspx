            <p class=" text-justify">MBEC has a GUIDE system whereby MBEC scholars help new scholars who are unfamiliar with aspects of the school. This encourages scholars to care for and take responsibility for others. Children achieve more if they are settled in a happy but disciplined environment. We promote this through a system of rewards and sanctions operating together. Alongside this is a clear discipline policy, which handles problems in a manner appropriate to the child and the offence. Parents will be notified and invited to discuss a matter further when it is considered that a child's behaviour is not acceptable. Bullying will not be tolerated in any circumstances and children are told to inform teachers or an adult if they see bullying taking place. </p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-justify">Our aim is to create an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust and responsibility. Positive behavior strategies are used in school and children are rewarded with a 'STAR' in the Almanac for good behavior.</p>
